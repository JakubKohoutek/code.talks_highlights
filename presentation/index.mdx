## Building with PWA 
<Cite>Jamie Maria Schouren</Cite>

## Do you know that?  

⏰ 53 % of users will leave a site if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load  
🌍 About 60 % of the world's population is still on 2G internet    
📳 Speed and usability plays a major role in user retention especially on mobile devices  

---

## PWA 

Progressive Web Apps combine the best of the web and the best of apps.  
They load quickly, even on flaky networks, have an icon on the home screen, 
can re-engage with users by sending push notifications, and load as top-level,
full screen applications.  
They also allow **device hardware access** that used to be available only to native apps.

---

## To Make PWA One Must

* Create "Web App Manifest" (JSON)  
* Serve site over https  
* Have a valid service worker registered  

When user visits the site on mobile device twice with at least 5 minutes between each 
visit, he is shown the prompt to save the site on Home Screen
